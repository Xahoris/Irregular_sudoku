# Irregular_sudoku
Final project sudoku Baptiste FASSLER

The sudoku is a japanese game that was created a long time ago in japan. It's a logic based puzzle where the goal is to fill up a 9x9 grid with number following several rules : 
- Each row must have differents numbers
- Each column must also contain different numbers 
- Each 3x3 square blocks must also countains differents numbers

So, depending of the informations you have in the beginning, the sudokus can be very easy to solve or also very hard.

It exists also irregular sudokus where the 3x3 square blocks are replaced by radoms blocks of size 9 cases.
In this project, we will use Prolog to developp a programm able to solve one configuration  of these types of sudoku for initial values given 

The code will be given in annex
